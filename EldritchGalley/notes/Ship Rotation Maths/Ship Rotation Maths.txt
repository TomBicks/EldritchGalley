Whilst lerp works somewhat well as the ships descends from a highpoint, it means the change in rotation is
sudden as it reaches the highpoint and then suddenly stops and goes back down again; there's no sense of
inertia.

Thus, I think the new system should be that I slowly and gradually faster add angle to the rotation, then
do the same in reverse, taking the rotation away slowly, then faster and faster as it reaches the other
highpoint, then repeat the process.
With any luck, simply doing this on a timer, with the rotation increasing or decreasing the less in left
in the timer, should work well.

Likewise, this increasing or decreasing 'value' that I add or subtract from the rotation angle could also
be the value I need to determine how much the ship creaks, as mentioned in the 'Creaking Noise Frequency'
note.
