Having an object counter-rotate against the camera's view_angle, and having the sprite centred in the room,
works well enough to make it look like a static background that isn't rotating with the rest of the game.

However, in order to have other elements work the same way and rotate with the background, in the same
position, the sprite needs to be as wide and as tall as the room and needs to be centred, even if the actual
content of the sprite is just a small sea-beast in the top middle.
So, more specifically, it would be a, say, 1300*800 sprite, with a 40*40 kraken sprite in one particular place
on the sprite.
It would essentially be transparent layers built up on one another, all controlled by the static background
controller object.
