Regarding the creaking of wood that sounds when a ship rocks back-and-forth on the water, I think I might
have an idea of how to time how frequent the creaking is, and when it occurs.

So, as a ship rocks, it tilts quickly at first, then tilts slower and slower, until it hits its precipice,
not unlike a lerp function (the same one I'll likely be using to calculate the tilting).

Well, what if I tied the creaking noise to trigger based on how quickly the room is tilting? That way, it
creaks more as it tilts more, as it should, and creaks only every so often as it tilts slower and slower.

So, for example, I could trigger the wood creaking noise every 5 degrees, so it triggers maybe 10 times
quickly initially, then only every so often as the change in degrees slows down.
